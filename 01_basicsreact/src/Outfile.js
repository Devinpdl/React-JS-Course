        <p>Now it'll work after capitalizing Function in React</p>
        <p>This was not working until we capitalize the function: anyfn()</p>
        </div>
    )
}
export default Anyfn; // we've to return our function is react.

//The above function Anyfn() is nothing but components in React.
// Command for React: npm run start.
// Command for Vite is : npm run dev.
// If we're wanting to convert react into html,css then we run:
// npm run build
// Better practice in react is to name your file in Capital letter as Outfile.js
